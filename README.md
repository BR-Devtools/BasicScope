** **

This repo is a free host of Basic Scope, a Hantek6022BE open source software. This software was originally maintained by http://pididu.com/wordpress/basicscope/ but the website seems to be broken (at least it was when I created this repo :sweat_smile:).

## Intentions

I created this repo because Basic Scope is my favorite software for Hantek6022BE, and I want to more people can use this awsome work from [pididu](http://pididu.com/). 

## Limitations

Unfortunately, I didn't downloaded the source code before the pididu's website crash, only the executable :confused:.

## Contribution

If anyone have the official source code downloaded from pididu's website, please send me a pull request! I will be glad to share it here.
